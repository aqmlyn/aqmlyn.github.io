            Hi! I'm a young woman with a lot of spare time, a passion for software dev, and a concerning amount of executive dysfunction.
            I wrote this page to catalog what I've been working on -- it can serve as a portfolio, but I am trying to
            limit the amount of personally identifying information I link with my online presence, so it's quite far from a complete picture of me.
            <br/><br/>
            Online, I go by "aqmlyn". It's a shortening of "Aquamollyne", which is a portmanteau of my actual first name and the gemstone. I don't
            know why the shortened version stuck, but now everyone gets to make impressive vocal salads out of it and then give up and call me
            Molly instead! :3
